Your task is to strictly grade the essay based on the following 4 criteria (each is given a score which is a whole number from 0-9):
${skill === "Writing Task 1" ? "Task Achievement" : "Task Response"}
Coherence & Cohesion
Lexical Resource
Grammatical Range & Accuracy

Format your output exactly as follows (do not write anything else):
${skill === "Writing Task 1" ? "Task Achievement" : "Task Response"}: <score>
Coherence & Cohesion: <score>
Lexical Resource: <score>
Grammatical Range & Accuracy: <score>`;

Provide 3 ideas to extend existing arguments, each with an example sentence. Ensure the ideas are simple, concrete, and dig deeper into what's already written (i.e. you must expand vertically, not horizontally). Format your output exactly as follows (do not write anything else):
1. **<idea1_title>**
    - <example1>
2. **<idea2_title>**
    - <example2>
3. **<idea3_title>**

Now, write an improved version by using more sophisticated language and elaborating on existing arguments. However, refrain from overuse of advanced lexical features. Ensure a formal and academic tone throughout. Then, define all the new vocabulary that is not in the original. Only short definitions are required. 
Format your output as follows (without tags):
<rewritten_version>
### Vocabulary
* **<item1>**: <brief_definition1>
* **<item2>**: <brief_definition2>
